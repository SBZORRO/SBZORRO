If x and y are actions of the same thread and x comes before y in program order, then hb(x, y).

There is a happens-before edge from the end of a constructor of an object to the start of a finalizer (ยง12.6) for that object.

If an action x synchronizes-with a following action y, then we also have hb(x, y).

If hb(x, y) and hb(y, z), then hb(x, z).




An unlock on a monitor happens-before every subsequent lock on that monitor.

A write to a volatile field (ยง8.3.1.4) happens-before every subsequent read of that field.

A call to start() on a thread happens-before any actions in the started thread.

All actions in a thread happen-before any other thread successfully returns from a join() on that thread.

The default initialization of any object happens-before any other actions (other than default-writes) of a program.
