Insertion:
Color flip: 
    x,B             x,R
  /   \     =>     /   \
c1,R  c2,R      c1,B    c2,B
IF x.parent is also RED, apply Zig/Zig-Zag!!!


Zig/Zig-Zag: old root => RED; new root => BLACK

Deletion:
Let p ==/= RED, X Will always end up with RED.
Thus, in the next loop or recursion, p will always be RED!!!

Recursion!!!
